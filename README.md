# Football Results Predictions for the 6 Major European National Leagues

This project objective is to predict the football results of the top 6 European National leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Portugal), for the current and following league rounds. For that, I extract data from the website <a href="https://www.resultados-futbol.com/">resultados-futbol.com</a> (file 1) and from the website <a href="https://www.fifaindex.com/">fifaindex.com</a> (file 2). Then, I cross data and create one single table (file 3) and later I fit different machine learning models with different combinations of parameters to find the best one (file 4). Finally, I apply that model to get the best predictions possible (file 5).

Any user can consult the predictions in a web app that I have built using Streamlit. You can check it in this URL: https://share.streamlit.io/tiagovilaverde/tfm_kschool/Streamlit_app_GCS.py

In the "Project Documentation" PDF file also present in this repo you will find detailed instructions on how to run all the code and replicate this project on your own.
